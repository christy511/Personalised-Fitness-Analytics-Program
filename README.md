# Customised-Fitness-Regimen

The Personalised Workout Program is a Python-based application designed to generate tailored fitness plans based on user input, including age, sex, and fitness goals.

## How it's Made
The application employs:
- **User Input Handling:** Collects basic information such as name, age, sex, and fitness objectives through simple input prompts. It ensures the inputs are valid through basic validation checks (e.g., age range and sex input verification).
- **Workout Intensity Adjustment:** Adjusts the number of reps or duration of exercises based on the user's age, utilizing mathematical modelling to scale workout intensity. This approach helps to customize the workout plan to be more suitable for different age groups, promoting safety and effectiveness.
- **Conditional Logic for Workout Customization:** Based on the user's input, the program selects from predefined workout routines targeting specific goals such as fat loss, strength building (legs, abs, shoulders, and arms), or high-intensity exercises.

## Running the Program
To start using the Personalised Workout Program:
1. Download or clone the program files to a local directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program with the command:
   ```
   python3 customised_fitness_regimen.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your personal details and select your fitness goals. The program will then display your personalized workout plan.

## Lessons Learned
Through the development of this program, the importance of user input validation for data integrity and the effectiveness of conditional logic in creating dynamic, user-specific content were reinforced. Additionally, the project highlights the potential of Python for quickly developing applications that can have a real-world impact.

## Future Enhancements
Future updates could include more advanced features such as:
- Incorporating a broader range of exercises and customization options.
- Integrating a more sophisticated algorithm for workout customization based on additional user parameters (e.g., weight, height, fitness level).
- Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user experience.
